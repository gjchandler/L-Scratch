					<li>The cost of sequencing the Human Genome have dropped even more quickly
					than would be been predicted by Mooreâ€™s Law.</li>
					<li>The genome can now be sequenced for about $1,200.</li>
					<li>This has greatly increased the number of genomes sequenced.</li>
					<li>However, as this happened, it become clear that many people have genes that
					never get expressed.</li>
					<li>Scientists started looking along the outside of the genome at methylation
						reactions that were proven to regulate gene expression (i.e., turn them on and
					off) and the science of Epigenetics was born.</li>
					<li>Epigenetic anaylysis uses the same technology, but focuses on the epigenome
					and can new be done for about $100 per test (in volume).</li>
