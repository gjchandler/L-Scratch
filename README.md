## What technology is under the hood?

### General Tech
This web stack features the usual suspects: NPM, gulp, SASS, Bootstrap, and a chart library.

Check out https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/ (2 -3 hours to complete the tutorial) for a really well thought out tutorial walking you through NPM, gulp, SASS and how all of them play together.

There is a short n' sweet version at http://ryanchristiani.com/getting-started-with-gulp-and-sass/ (~30 minute read) if you already know a bit about NPM and gulp.
